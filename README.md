A CakePHP 3.x Plugin containing a RssView class to generate RSS feeds.

## Version notice

This branch only works for **CakePHP 3.x** - please use the 2.x branch for CakePHP 2.x.

## What is this plugin for?
There is a core helper for RSS generation, but it has several deficiencies.

### Goals of this view class

- Support view-less actions via serialize.
- Get rid of the ridiculously verbose "inline" namespace declarations.
- Simplify the use of namespaces and their prefixes (auto-add only those that are actually used).
- Support CDATA (unescaped content).

### Additional features
- Automatic View class mapping via `rss` extension.

See [my article](http://www.dereuromark.de/2013/10/03/rss-feeds-in-cakephp/) for details on the history of this view class.

## Installation & Docs

- [Documentation](docs/README.md)

### Possible TODOs

* Maybe add Feed readers instead of just writers.
* Add AtomView ?
